# Study Notes Module Alignment

This reference links every EMT-B study note chapter to its corresponding module. Modules intentionally mirror national education standards: early sections group foundational material together, while advanced topics stand alone because they represent full week blocks in most programs.

| Module | Title | Chapters | Count | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Module 1 | Foundations of EMS Practice | 1, 2, 3, 4 | 4 | Broad orientation topics grouped so learners see system, safety, legal, and communications content together. |
| Module 2 | Clinical Foundations | 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 | 5 | Core science and movement skills; additional chapter (9) carries interprofessional competencies that bridge Module 1 and assessment content. |
| Module 3 | Patient Assessment Mastery | 10 | 1 | Dedicated full-length module for comprehensive assessment; typically taught over several lab sessions so the chapter stands alone. |
| Module 4 | Airway & Ventilatory Management | 11 | 1 | Airway mastery is a standalone block with extensive lab practice; keeping a single focus clarifies priorities. |
| Module 5 | Pharmacology for EMT-B | 12 | 1 | Medication administration scope for EMT-B is concentrated into one detailed unit. |
| Module 6 | Shock & Circulatory Management | 13, 14 | 2 | Shock physiology and BLS life support are paired because protocol updates overlap heavily. |
| Module 7 | Medical Emergency Response | 15, 16, 17 | 3 | Respiratory and cardiovascular crises live together for systems-based review. |
| Module 8 | Neurologic & Systemic Emergencies | 18, 19, 20 | 3 | High-acuity neurologic, abdominal, metabolic, and hematologic conditions. |
| Module 9 | Specialized Emergency Care | 21, 22, 23, 24 | 4 | Allergic, toxicological, behavioral, and gynecologic emergencies frequently taught as a specialty block. |
| Module 10 | Trauma Response Principles | 25, 26, 27 | 3 | Trauma system fundamentals with hemorrhage and soft tissue management. |
| Module 11 | Traumatic Injury Management | 28, 29, 30 | 3 | Craniofacial, spinal, and thoracic trauma require contiguous emphasis. |
| Module 12 | Environmental & Musculoskeletal Emergencies | 31, 32, 33 | 3 | Environmental exposure paired with orthopedic and abdominal trauma follow-ups. |
| Module 13 | Special Patient Populations | 34, 35, 36, 37 | 4 | Obstetric, neonatal, pediatric, geriatric, and special populations consolidated for comparative study. |
| Module 14 | EMS Operations & Disaster Response | 38, 39, 40, 41 | 4 | Operations, technical rescue, ICS, and MCI are operationally linked and typically taught consecutively. |
| Advanced Track | Chapters 42–45, Bonus anatomy series | 10+ | Extended physiology deep dives and cellular refreshers for accelerated cohorts. |

## Why modules differ in chapter counts

- **Single chapter modules (3–5)** represent lab-intensive weeks where practical skills dominate (assessment, airway, pharmacology). Keeping them isolated ensures the enhanced reader can surface lab checklists, video embeds, and assessment rubrics without distraction.
- **Five-chapter Module 2** front-loads terminology and movement because most EMT programs assess those skills together before field internships.
- **Module 6’s two chapters** mirror how national standards pair shock physiology directly with BLS circulatory protocols; separating them reduced retention in early pilots.

## Using this document

- Link this mapping in onboarding material so students know what to expect before entering the study notes navigator.
- Curriculum designers can reference it when aligning quizzes, lab rubrics, or prerequisite reminders.
- If future restructuring is needed, update the `modules` array in `src/components/StudyNotesNavigator.tsx` and adjust this table to match the new structure.
