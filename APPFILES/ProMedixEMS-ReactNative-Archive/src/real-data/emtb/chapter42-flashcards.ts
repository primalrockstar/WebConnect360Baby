    front: "What is preload?",
    back: "The volume of blood in the ventricles at the end of diastole; represents venous return and ventricular filling pressure"
  },
  {
    front: "What is afterload?",
    back: "The resistance that the ventricles must overcome to eject blood; primarily determined by arterial pressure and vascular resistance"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the Frank-Starling mechanism?",
    back: "The principle that increased venous return (preload) leads to increased stroke volume due to optimal sarcomere length"
  },
  {
    front: "What is stroke volume?",
    back: "The amount of blood ejected by the left ventricle with each heartbeat, normally 60-80 mL"
  },
  {
    front: "How is cardiac output calculated?",
    back: "Cardiac Output = Stroke Volume × Heart Rate (normal ~5 L/min)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is ejection fraction?",
    back: "Percentage of blood pumped out of left ventricle with each contraction; normal is 55-70%"
  },
  {
    front: "What are the phases of the cardiac cycle?",
    back: "Systole (contraction/ejection) and diastole (relaxation/filling), with isovolumetric phases"
  },
  {
    front: "What is contractility?",
    back: "The intrinsic ability of cardiac muscle to contract independent of preload and afterload"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the coronary circulation pathway?",
    back: "Right coronary artery supplies inferior wall; left anterior descending and circumflex supply anterior and lateral walls"
  },
  {
    front: "What happens during diastole?",
    back: "Ventricular filling, coronary perfusion occurs, AV valves open, semilunar valves closed"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the cardiac conduction system sequence?",
    back: "SA node → atria → AV node → Bundle of His → bundle branches → Purkinje fibers"
  },
  {
    front: "What is ventricular compliance?",
    back: "The ability of ventricles to stretch and fill with blood; decreased in heart failure and hypertrophy"
  },
  {
    front: "What factors increase oxygen demand of the heart?",
    back: "Increased heart rate, contractility, wall tension (preload/afterload), and myocardial mass"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the pressure-volume loop?",
    back: "Graphical representation of ventricular pressure vs. volume throughout the cardiac cycle"
  },
  {
    front: "What are collateral coronary vessels?",
    back: "Alternative blood pathways that can develop to bypass blocked coronary arteries"
