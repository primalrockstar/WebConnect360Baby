  {
    front: "What is lung compliance?",
    back: "A measure of lung elasticity; the change in lung volume per unit change in pressure (ΔV/ΔP)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is elastance?",
    back: "The reciprocal of compliance; the tendency of lungs to recoil to their resting position"
  },
  {
    front: "What is anatomical dead space?",
    back: "Portions of the respiratory system where no gas exchange occurs (trachea, bronchi, bronchioles)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is physiological dead space?",
    back: "Anatomical dead space plus alveolar dead space (alveoli ventilated but not perfused)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is a ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch?",
    back: "Imbalance between alveolar ventilation and capillary blood flow; normal ratio is ~0.8"
  },
  {
    front: "What is shunt?",
    back: "Blood that bypasses ventilated alveoli, causing venous blood to mix with arterial blood"
  },
  {
    front: "What factors affect gas diffusion across alveoli?",
    back: "Surface area, membrane thickness, pressure gradient, and gas solubility"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the work of breathing?",
    back: "Energy required to overcome elastic recoil and airway resistance during ventilation"
  },
  {
    front: "What controls respiratory drive?",
    back: "Medullary respiratory centers respond to CO2 (primary), pH, and O2 levels"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the Bohr effect?",
    back: "Decreased pH (increased CO2) shifts oxygen-hemoglobin curve right, promoting O2 release"
  },
  {
    front: "What is functional residual capacity (FRC)?",
    back: "Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of normal expiration (~2300 mL)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is closing capacity?",
    back: "Lung volume at which small airways begin to close, trapping air in alveoli"
  },
  {
    front: "What is hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction?",
    back: "Pulmonary arteries constrict in response to low oxygen to redirect blood to better-ventilated areas"
  },
  {
    front: "What is respiratory quotient (RQ)?",
    back: "Ratio of CO2 produced to O2 consumed; reflects metabolic substrate being used"
  },
  {
    front: "What is surfactant?",
    back: "Phospholipid that reduces surface tension in alveoli, preventing collapse and reducing work of breathing"
  }
