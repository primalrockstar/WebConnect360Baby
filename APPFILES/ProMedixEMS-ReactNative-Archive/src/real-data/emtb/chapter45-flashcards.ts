  {
    front: "What is negative feedback?",
    back: "Regulatory mechanism where the output inhibits the stimulus; maintains homeostasis (e.g., insulin-glucose)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is positive feedback?",
    back: "Regulatory mechanism where output amplifies the stimulus; usually for specific events (e.g., labor contractions)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is gluconeogenesis?",
    back: "Production of glucose from non-carbohydrate sources (amino acids, lactate, glycerol) primarily in liver"
  },
  {
    front: "What is ketogenesis?",
    back: "Production of ketone bodies from fatty acids during fasting or low carbohydrate states"
  },
  {
    front: "What is insulin resistance?",
    back: "Decreased cellular response to insulin, requiring higher insulin levels to maintain normal glucose"
  },
  {
    front: "What hormones are produced by the pancreas?",
    back: "Insulin (beta cells), glucagon (alpha cells), somatostatin (delta cells)"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the hypothalamic-pituitary axis?",
    back: "Control system linking nervous and endocrine systems; hypothalamus controls pituitary hormone release"
  },
  {
    front: "What are the functions of cortisol?",
    back: "Increases glucose, suppresses immune system, anti-inflammatory, stress response hormone"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the difference between T3 and T4?",
    back: "T4 (thyroxine) is prohormone; T3 (triiodothyronine) is active form, 3-4x more potent"
  },
  {
    front: "What regulates calcium homeostasis?",
    back: "Parathyroid hormone (increases Ca²⁺) and calcitonin (decreases Ca²⁺) with vitamin D"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system?",
    back: "Hormonal system regulating blood pressure and fluid balance through vasoconstriction and sodium retention"
  },
  {
    front: "What are circadian rhythms?",
    back: "24-hour biological cycles controlled by suprachiasmatic nucleus; affect hormone release and metabolism"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the dawn phenomenon?",
    back: "Early morning rise in blood glucose due to growth hormone, cortisol, and catecholamine release"
  },
  {
    front: "What is metabolic syndrome?",
    back: "Cluster of conditions: insulin resistance, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia increasing cardiovascular risk"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the role of leptin?",
    back: "Hormone produced by fat cells that signals satiety to brain and regulates energy balance"
  }
