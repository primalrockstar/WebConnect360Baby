    front: "What are the three depths of burns?",
    back: "Superficial (first-degree), partial-thickness (second-degree), and full-thickness (third-degree)"
  },
  {
    front: "What characterizes a superficial burn?",
    back: "Red, painful, involves only epidermis, no blisters (like mild sunburn)"
  },
  {
    front: "What characterizes a partial-thickness burn?",
    back: "Red, painful with blisters, involves epidermis and part of dermis"
  },
  {
    front: "What characterizes a full-thickness burn?",
    back: "White/charred, painless (nerve damage), involves all skin layers"
  },
  {
    front: "How do you calculate burn percentage using Rule of Nines?",
    back: "Head 9%, each arm 9%, chest 18%, back 18%, each leg 18%, genitals 1%"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the palmer method for burn estimation?",
    back: "Patient's palm (including fingers) equals approximately 1% of body surface area"
  },
  {
    front: "What defines a critical burn in adults?",
    back: "Full-thickness >10%, partial-thickness >25%, or burns to face/hands/feet/genitals/airway"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the primary concern with electrical burns?",
    back: "Internal injury along path of current - external appearance doesn't reflect damage"
  },
  {
    front: "How should you cool a thermal burn?",
    back: "Cool running water for 10-20 minutes, but avoid hypothermia in large burns"
  },
  {
    front: "What should you NOT use on burns?",
    back: "Ice, butter, ointments, or break blisters - can worsen injury"
  },
  {
    front: "What are signs of inhalation injury?",
    back: "Facial burns, singed nasal hair, carbonaceous sputum, altered voice, respiratory distress"
  },
  {
    front: "How do you treat chemical burns?",
    back: "Remove contaminated clothing and irrigate with large amounts of water"
  },
  {
    front: "What is special about electrical burn management?",
    back: "Check for cardiac dysrhythmias, compartment syndrome, and spinal injuries from falls"
  },
  {
    front: "When is immediate transport indicated for burns?",
    back: "Airway involvement, >20% partial-thickness, >10% full-thickness, or electrical/chemical burns"
  },
  {
    front: "What fluid resuscitation is needed for major burns?",
    back: "Large-bore IV access for burns >20% BSA, but this is typically ALS intervention"
