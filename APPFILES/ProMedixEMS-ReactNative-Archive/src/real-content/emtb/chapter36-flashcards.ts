  {
    front: "When should you request air medical transport?",
    back: "Extended transport time, difficult ground access, need for specialty care, traffic delays"
  },
  {
    front: "What are the advantages of air medical transport?",
    back: "Speed, advanced life support capabilities, access to specialty centers, difficult terrain access"
  },
  {
    front: "What are helicopter landing zone requirements?",
    back: "100x100 feet minimum, firm level surface, no loose debris, clear of obstacles"
  },
  {
    front: "How should you approach a helicopter?",
    back: "From the front, stay low, wait for crew signal, never approach tail rotor"
  },
  {
    front: "What are the danger areas around helicopters?",
    back: "Tail rotor (most dangerous), main rotor, exhaust, and slope-side on uneven ground"
  },
  {
    front: "What ground preparation is needed for helicopter landing?",
    back: "Remove loose objects, wet down dust, mark hazards, provide wind direction indicator"
  },
  {
    front: "How do you communicate with helicopter crew?",
    back: "Radio contact, ground guide signals, eye contact with pilot before approach"
  },
  {
    front: "What weather conditions affect helicopter operations?",
    back: "High winds, low visibility, icing conditions, thunderstorms, turbulence"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the difference between HEMS and air ambulance?",
    back: "HEMS (helicopter), air ambulance (fixed-wing), both provide medical transport"
  },
  {
    front: "What patient information should you relay to flight crew?",
    back: "Age, sex, chief complaint, vital signs, treatments given, weight estimate"
  },
  {
    front: "When might helicopter transport be cancelled?",
    back: "Weather conditions, patient condition changes, ground transport faster"
  },
  {
    front: "What are night landing considerations?",
    back: "Additional lighting required, increased safety precautions, noise considerations"
  },
  {
    front: "How do you mark a landing zone at night?",
    back: "White lights at corners, red lights for hazards, avoid shining lights at aircraft"
  },
  {
    front: "What are the altitude limitations for helicopters?",
    back: "Decreased performance at high altitude, weight restrictions, weather sensitivity"
  },
  {
    front: "What is the typical transport range for HEMS?",
    back: "Usually within 150-200 mile radius, depends on fuel capacity and weather"
